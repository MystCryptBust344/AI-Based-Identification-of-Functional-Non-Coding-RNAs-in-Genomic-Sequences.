# AI-Based-Identification-of-Functional-Non-Coding-RNAs-in-Genomic-Sequences.

AI-Based Identification: This refers to using artificial intelligence methods, likely machine learning or deep learning algorithms, to analyze and identify specific elements in genomic data.

Functional Non-Coding RNAs: These are RNA molecules that are transcribed from DNA but do not encode proteins. Despite not being translated into proteins, they play important regulatory and functional roles in various biological processes.

Genomic Sequences: This refers to the complete set of genetic material (DNA or RNA) in an organism
